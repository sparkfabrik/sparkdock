## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Fixed Python interpreter not found error by implementing `ensure_python3()` function that checks for missing python3 symlink and automatically relinks Python packages before running Ansible playbook
- Fixed sjust zsh completion file ownership issue where `_sjust` file could be owned by root, causing Ansible task failures

### Added
- Added Sparkdock shell configuration system with modern CLI tools (eza, bat, ripgrep, fd, zoxide, fzf) and optional oh-my-zsh integration with plugins and starship prompt
- Added Claude Code GitHub workflow for AI-assisted code reviews and issue handling
- Added `ensure-python3` command mode to `sparkdock.macos` for checking and fixing Python3 symlink issues (callable via `sparkdock ensure-python3`)
- Added GitHub Copilot CLI (`@github/copilot`) as a default npm package installation

### Changed
- Updated system requirements documentation to clarify Apple Silicon-only support (removed Intel Mac references)

### Changed
- Renamed `sparkdock-update-repository` command to `sparkdock-fetch-updates` with improved description and updated output messages
- Lima quick setup now uses dynamic CPU and memory defaults like Docker Desktop: all available processors and 50% of host memory
- Shell aliases now check for command existence before aliasing to avoid breaking standard Unix tools
- Improved `ls` implementation with smart handling of `-lt` and `-ltr` flags for sorting by modification time
- Simplified Homebrew prefix logic to use `/opt/homebrew` consistently on macOS
- User configuration directory changed from `~/.sparkdock` to `~/.config/spark`

### Fixed
- Fixed `lima-destroy` command to handle VMs that are already stopped, preventing fatal error when VM is not running
