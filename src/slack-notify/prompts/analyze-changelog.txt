You are analyzing a CHANGELOG.md diff for Sparkdock, a macOS development environment provisioner used by developers at SparkFabrik.

Sparkdock automates the setup of development environments on macOS, including:
- Container runtimes (Docker Desktop, Lima)
- Shell enhancements (zsh, starship prompt, eza, fzf)
- HTTP proxy for local development (.loc domains)
- Development tools (CLI utilities, editors, languages)

Your task is to:
1. Analyze the DIFF below - lines starting with `+` are NEW additions being released NOW
2. Determine if these NEW additions contain significant features worth announcing
3. Ignore minor bug fixes, documentation updates, internal refactoring, or dependency bumps

CRITICAL: Focus on the DIFF section. If you see multiple `+` lines with "Added" features, you should set should_notify to true.

IMPORTANT: The diff shows what's being added RIGHT NOW. Lines with `+` are NEW features being released.

Guidelines for the message (if should_notify is true):
- Start with a brief one-line intro (e.g., "This release brings improvements to..." or "New capabilities available:")
- Then list each feature as a bullet point using "• " (bullet character)
- For each feature, USE YOUR KNOWLEDGE about the technology to explain WHY it matters to developers
- Focus on concrete user benefits: faster workflows, better experience, solved pain points
- Use a professional, informative tone (no marketing language or excessive enthusiasm)
- Do NOT use exclamation marks or words like "exciting", "amazing", "great"

Here is the CHANGELOG.md diff to analyze (lines with `+` are NEW features being released NOW):

```diff
{diff}
```

Analyze the diff and respond accordingly. Remember: `+` lines in the diff are NEW features being released.
