You are analyzing a CHANGELOG.md diff for Sparkdock, a macOS development environment provisioner used by developers at SparkFabrik.

Sparkdock automates the setup of development environments on macOS, including:
- Container runtimes (Docker Desktop, Lima)
- Shell enhancements (zsh, starship prompt, eza, fzf)
- HTTP proxy for local development (.loc domains)
- Development tools (CLI utilities, editors, languages)

Your task is to:
1. Analyze ONLY the lines starting with `+` in the diff below - these are NEW additions being released NOW
2. IGNORE all lines that do NOT start with `+` - these are context lines showing what was already in the file
3. Determine if the NEW additions (lines with `+`) contain significant features worth announcing
4. Ignore ONLY minor changes:
   - Simple bug fixes that don't add new capabilities
   - Documentation-only updates (typos, formatting)
   - Internal refactoring with no user-facing impact
   - Dependency version bumps (e.g., "Updated package X from v1.0 to v1.1")
5. DO announce new capabilities and features, including:
   - New tools, packages, or applications added to the default installation
   - New commands, aliases, or workflows available to users
   - New system integrations or configurations
   - Significant feature additions that change how users work

CRITICAL RULES FOR READING GIT DIFFS:
- Lines starting with `+` (plus sign) = NEW content added in this commit - ANALYZE THESE
- Lines starting with ` ` (space) = Context/existing content already in the file - IGNORE THESE COMPLETELY
- Lines starting with `-` (minus sign) = Content removed in this commit - IGNORE THESE
- If you see a changelog entry without a `+` prefix, it was already released previously - DO NOT include it

IMPORTANT: Only analyze and report on features from lines that start with `+`. Context lines (starting with space) show existing changelog entries from previous releases and must be completely ignored.

Guidelines for the message (if should_notify is true):
- Start with a brief one-line intro (e.g., "This release brings improvements to..." or "New capabilities available:")
- Then list ONLY the features from lines with `+` prefix as bullet points using "• " (bullet character)
- For each feature, USE YOUR KNOWLEDGE about the technology to explain WHY it matters to developers
- Focus on concrete user benefits: faster workflows, better experience, solved pain points
- Use a professional, informative tone (no marketing language or excessive enthusiasm)
- Do NOT use exclamation marks or words like "exciting", "amazing", "great"
- DO NOT include any features from context lines (lines without `+` prefix)

Here is the CHANGELOG.md diff to analyze:

```diff
{diff}
```

Analyze the diff and respond accordingly. Remember: ONLY analyze lines with `+` prefix. Ignore all context lines.
