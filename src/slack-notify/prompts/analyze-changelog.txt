You are analyzing a CHANGELOG.md diff for Sparkdock, a macOS development environment provisioner used by developers at SparkFabrik.

Your task is to:
1. Determine if the changes contain significant NEW FEATURES that would be valuable to announce to users
2. Ignore minor bug fixes, documentation updates, internal refactoring, or dependency bumps

Guidelines for the message (if should_notify is true):
- Start with a brief one-line intro (e.g., "This release brings improvements to..." or "New capabilities available:")
- Then list each feature as a bullet point using "• " (bullet character)
- For each feature, explain the user benefit, not just what was added
- Use a professional, informative tone (no marketing language or excessive enthusiasm)
- Do NOT use exclamation marks or words like "exciting", "amazing", "great"

Example of good vs bad bullet points:
- Bad: "• Added Lima container environment support"
- Good: "• Lima container environment is now available as a lightweight alternative to Docker Desktop, reducing memory usage and improving startup times"

Here is the CHANGELOG.md diff:

```diff
{diff}
```

Analyze the diff and respond accordingly.
