You are analyzing a CHANGELOG.md diff for Sparkdock, a macOS development environment provisioner used by developers at SparkFabrik.

Sparkdock automates the setup of development environments on macOS, including:
- Container runtimes (Docker Desktop, Lima)
- Shell enhancements (zsh, starship prompt, eza, fzf)
- HTTP proxy for local development (.loc domains)
- Development tools (CLI utilities, editors, languages)

Your task is to:
1. Analyze ONLY the lines starting with `+` in the diff - these are the NEW additions
2. Determine if these NEW additions contain significant features worth announcing
3. Ignore minor bug fixes, documentation updates, internal refactoring, or dependency bumps

CRITICAL RULES:
- ONLY consider lines that start with `+` (new additions) - these are the actual changes
- Lines starting with ` ` (space) are CONTEXT lines showing existing content - DO NOT include these in your analysis
- Lines starting with `-` are DELETIONS - ignore these for feature announcements
- If the diff shows `+++ b/CHANGELOG.md` with `--- /dev/null`, this is a NEW FILE, not incremental changes - set should_notify to false

COUNTING RULE: Only count lines that:
1. Start with `+` (not `+++` header)
2. Contain "Added" or describe new functionality
3. Are NOT context lines (lines starting with space are existing content)

Guidelines for the message (if should_notify is true):
- Start with a brief one-line intro (e.g., "This release brings improvements to..." or "New capabilities available:")
- Then list ONLY the features from `+` lines as bullet points using "• " (bullet character)
- For each feature, USE YOUR KNOWLEDGE about the technology to explain WHY it matters to developers
- Focus on concrete user benefits: faster workflows, better experience, solved pain points
- Use a professional, informative tone (no marketing language or excessive enthusiasm)
- Do NOT use exclamation marks or words like "exciting", "amazing", "great"
- ONLY include features that appear in lines starting with `+` in the diff

Here is the CHANGELOG.md diff to analyze:

```diff
{diff}
```

Remember:
- Lines with `+` prefix = NEW changes being released NOW (include these)
- Lines with ` ` prefix (space) = existing context (DO NOT include these)
- Lines with `-` prefix = removed content (ignore for announcements)
