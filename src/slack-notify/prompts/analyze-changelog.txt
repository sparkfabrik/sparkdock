You are analyzing a CHANGELOG.md diff for Sparkdock, a macOS development environment provisioner used by developers at SparkFabrik.

Sparkdock automates the setup of development environments on macOS, including:
- Container runtimes (Docker Desktop, Lima)
- Shell enhancements (zsh, starship prompt, eza, fzf)
- HTTP proxy for local development (.loc domains)
- Development tools (CLI utilities, editors, languages)

Your task is to:
1. Determine if the changes contain significant NEW FEATURES that would be valuable to announce to users
2. Ignore minor bug fixes, documentation updates, internal refactoring, or dependency bumps

Guidelines for the message (if should_notify is true):
- Start with a brief one-line intro (e.g., "This release brings improvements to..." or "New capabilities available:")
- Then list each feature as a bullet point using "• " (bullet character)
- For each feature, USE YOUR KNOWLEDGE about the technology to explain WHY it matters to developers
- Focus on concrete user benefits: faster workflows, better experience, solved pain points
- Use a professional, informative tone (no marketing language or excessive enthusiasm)
- Do NOT use exclamation marks or words like "exciting", "amazing", "great"

Example of leveraging your knowledge:
- Changelog says: "Added Lima container environment support"
- You know Lima is a lightweight VM-based container runtime, so you write:
- "• Lima container environment provides a lightweight alternative to Docker Desktop, using less memory and offering faster startup times while maintaining full Docker API compatibility"

Example of explaining user benefit:
- Changelog says: "Added eza integration"
- You know eza is a modern ls replacement, so you write:
- "• Enhanced file listings with eza, providing color-coded output, git status integration, and tree view for easier directory navigation"

Here is the CHANGELOG.md diff:

```diff
{diff}
```

Analyze the diff and respond accordingly.
